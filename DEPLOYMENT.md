# Deploying to Vercel

This Taboo Card Game is a frontend-only application and can be easily deployed to Vercel.

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
3. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect the Vite framework
6. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI:

   ```

2. Run deployment command:
   ```bash

   ```

## Configuration

The project includes a `vercel.json` file with the following configuration:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (builds the Vite frontend)
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public` (where Vite outputs the built files)
- **Rewrites**: All routes redirect to `index.html` for client-side routing

## Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment, you can add a custom domain:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Domains"
